# frameworkless-api-java
Creating an API with Java without any framework.

This API was developed only for practice and study, and because that, it hasn't connection with any database.

And thanks to https://github.com/piczmar for creating a tutorial at https://dev.to/piczmar_0/framework-less-rest-api-in-java-1jbl that helped me a lot.
